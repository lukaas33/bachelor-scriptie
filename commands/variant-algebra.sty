% Custom commands for variant algebra notation
%
%
% A variant is represented by a pair (R, \phi)
\newcommandx{\variant}[2][1=$R$, 2=$\phi$]{(#1, #2)}
% R is a string of symbols from the reference sequence, which is a non-empty alphabet \sigma
\newcommandx{\reference}[0]{$R$}
% \phi is a set of operations that transforms the string R into the observed string O
% This is dependent on the variant representation language
\newcommandx{\operations}[0]{$\phi$}
%
% The length of a string S is represented by |S|
\newcommandx{\length}[1]{$\lvert #1 \rvert$}
% A symbol in a string S is represented by S_i with 1 \le i \le |S|
\newcommandx{\position}[2][1=$S$, 2=$i$]{$#1_#2$}
% A substring of a string S is represented by S_{i...j} with 1 \le i \lt j \le |S|
\newcommandx{\substring}[3][1=$S$, 2=$i$, 3=$j$]{$#1_{#2 \dots #3$}}
