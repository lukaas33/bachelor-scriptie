%
% R is a string of symbols from the reference sequence, which is a non-empty alphabet \sigma (often {A, C, G, T})
\newcommandx{\reference}[0]{R}
%
% \phi is a set of operations that transforms the string R into the observed string O
% Operations are deletions and insertions
\newcommandx{\observed}[0]{O}
\newcommandx{\operations}[0]{\varphi}
% 
% A variant is represented by a pair (R, \phi)
\newcommandx{\variant}[2][1=\reference, 2=\operations]{(#1, #2)}
%
% The length of a string S is represented by |S|
\newcommandx{\length}[1][1=S]{\lvert #1 \rvert}
%
% A symbol in a string S is represented by S_i with 1 \le i \le |S|
\newcommandx{\position}[2][1=S, 2=i]{#1_#2}
%
% A substring of a string S is represented by S_{i...j} with 1 \le i \lt j \le |S|
\newcommandx{\substring}[3][1=S, 2=i, 3=j]{#1_{#2 \dots #3}}
% 
% The difference between sequences is represented with a small d
% It is defined by the simple edit distance between the sequences
\newcommandx{\distance}[2][1=\reference, 2=\observed]{d(#1, #2)}
% 
% The set of all minimal representations of an observed sequence is represented with \Phi(R, O)
\newcommandx{\minset}[2][1=\reference, 2=\observed]{\Phi(#1, #2)}
% 
% The set of all elements that occur in any minimal representation of \Phi(R,O) is represented as \Psi(R, O)
\newcommandx{\minsetall}[2][1=\reference, 2=\observed]{\Psi(#1, #2)}
