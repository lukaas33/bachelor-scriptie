Based on the definitions of the relations, some relations are redundant. 
These relations can be pruned from the graph without loss of information since they are implicit from other relations. 
This pruning process results in a more sparse graph which is more easily interpreted by humans.
In the following instances relations can be pruned:
\paragraph*{Reflexivity} The equivalence relation is reflexive. Since every variant is equivalent to itself, the relation can be pruned.
